# 🌍 IoT-Based Air Quality Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview
This project is an IoT-enabled smart air quality monitoring system that tracks **Air Quality Index (AQI)**, **temperature**, and **humidity** in real time. It leverages the **MQ-135 sensor** to detect harmful gases (e.g., CO₂, NH₃, benzene, smoke) and the **DHT22 sensor** for environmental readings.

The system provides actionable insights about pollution levels by sending data to the **Blynk IoT Cloud Platform**, enabling remote access via a smartphone. It is especially useful for urban areas, industries, and indoor environments where air quality impacts health directly.

## 🛠 Hardware Used
- **Arduino UNO** – Sensor data acquisition  
- **NodeMCU ESP8266** – WiFi-enabled data transmission  
- **MQ-135 Gas Sensor** – Detects harmful gases & air quality levels  
- **DHT22 Sensor** – Measures temperature & humidity  
- Jumper Wires & Breadboard  
- Power Supply  

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Data Acquisition** – MQ-135 detects gas concentration, and DHT22 measures temperature & humidity.  
2. **Processing** – Arduino UNO processes the raw data and formats it.  
3. **Communication** – Data is transmitted to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial.  
4. **Cloud Upload** – ESP8266 pushes the readings to the Blynk IoT Cloud over WiFi.  
5. **Visualization** – The Blynk app dashboard displays gauges, graphs, and indicators in real time.  
6. **AQI Calculation** – The system computes a simplified AQI index based on the collected data.  

## 📊 Features
- ✅ Real-time air quality monitoring (gas + temperature + humidity)  
- ✅ AQI calculation with user-friendly health indicators  
- ✅ Mobile app dashboard with interactive charts, gauges, and status alerts  
- ✅ Wireless IoT data transmission via ESP8266  
- ✅ Scalable design – can integrate more sensors (CO, PM2.5, PM10, CO₂, etc.)  
- ✅ Low-cost, portable, and DIY-friendly system  
- 🔔 Automatic alerts via SMS/Email when AQI crosses a threshold  

## 🌐 Real-Life Applications
- 🏠 **Smart Homes** – Track indoor pollution and humidity levels.  
- 🏭 **Industrial Monitoring** – Ensure worker safety in polluted areas.  
- 🏥 **Hospitals & Labs** – Monitor clean-air conditions for sensitive patients/equipment.  
- 🌆 **Urban Cities** – Collect large-scale data for pollution analysis.  
- 🚗 **Vehicle Emissions** – Detect harmful gases in garages or tunnels.  

## 🚀 Output Example
**Live Dashboard Readings (Blynk IoT):**
- 🌡 Temperature: 34.9°C  
- 💧 Humidity: 35.1%  
- 🌫 AQI: 16 (Good 😊)  

**AQI Status Levels:**
| AQI | Status |
|-----|-------|
| 0–50 | Good 😊 |
| 51–100 | Moderate 😐 |
| 101–150 | Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups 😷 |
| 151–200 | Unhealthy 😨 |
| 201–300 | Very Unhealthy ☠ |
| 301+ | Hazardous 💀 |
